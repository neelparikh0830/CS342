Connect Four is played on a grid of 7 columns and 6 rows.
It is a two player game where each player takes a turn dropping a checker into a
slot (one of the columns) on the game board. That checker will fall down the
column and either land on top of another checker or land on the bottom row.
To win the game, a player needs to get 4 of their checkers in a vertical,
horizontal or diagonal row before the other player.
